Human leukemia K562 cells have been used as a model to study megakaryocytic differentiation. In the present study, to investigate the effects of radiation on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, the cellular processes responsible for the expression of CD41 antigen (GPIIb/IIIa), which is reported to be expressed early in megakaryocyte maturation, were analyzed. The expression of CD41 antigens was significantly increased 72 h after treatment with both 4 Gy X-irradiation and PMA. In this fraction, two populations, CD41(low) and CD41(high) cells, were detected by flow cytometry. The CD41(high) cells sustained intracellular ROS at the initial level for up to 72 h, but CD41(low) cells had reduced ROS by 48 h. The maximum suppressive effect on CD41 expression was observed when N-acetyl cysteine, which is known to act as a ROS scavenger, was administered 48 h after PMA stimulation. When K562 cells were pretreated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitors, an ERK1/2 inhibitor and a p38 MAPK inhibitor, followed by X-irradiation and PMA stimulation, the reactivity profiles of both inhibitors showed the involvement of MAPK pathway. There is a possibility that the K562 cell population contains at least two types of radiosensitive megakaryocytic progenitors with respect to ROS production mechanisms, and intracellular ROS levels determine the extent of CD41 expression.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of radiation on the maturation of megakaryocytes","doi":"10.1093/jrr/rrs127","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jrr/rrs127","venue":"Journal of radiation research"}

An early diagnosis is therefore necessary.\n\n\nMETHOD/PATIENTS\n182 consecutive patients with an age up to 10 years were diagnosed with permanent hearing loss in the mild to profound range in a defined 5-years-period (1.10.1994-30.9.1999) in the Pedaudiologic Outpatient Clinic of the University Göttingen. Fifty children (27.5%) had a unilateral hearing loss (30 sensorineural, 20 conductive caused by aural atresia with or without microtia), 132 a bilateral one. This paper presents the data of the consecutive series of the 30 sensorineural unilaterally hearing-impaired children (> 25 dB).\n\n\nRESULTS\nA slight male predominance was present (53.3%). The left ear was affected in 43.3%, the right ear in 56.7%. In the majority of the cases the hearing loss was severe and profound. The hearing-impairments were diagnosed by the median age of 69.5 months and all aided by the median age of 70 months. The etiology remained unknown in 60 per cent of the cases. Hearing aid acceptance at the first follow-up (on average after 6 months) was found to be 79 per cent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe data suggest the relevance and necessity of a pedaudiometric prevention. They demonstrate the urgent necessity of a molecular genetic cause investigation. Recessive sensorineural hearing loss with onset in infancy may exist with no antecedent family history.","inCitations":["d74955ebba7ca098f8fcef8534ad60434077a054","a271f9282560f67a89c9b6644d23b83d51e8842a","e5cab4cb71e4359edfdddb1408657445f8530c52","255ef4f76188c53ee7c893c58b5f8345fe1f4837"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Unilateral hearing loss in childhood.

However, with the development of new technologies to measure the intracellular free concentration of magnesium ([Mg2+]i), the biologically important fraction, there has been an explosion of interest in the molecular, biochemical, physiological and pharmacological functions of magnesium. In addition improved methods for assessing magnesium status in the clinic have contributed to the further understanding of magnesium regulation in health and disease. Magnesium deficiency is now considered to contribute to many diseases and the role for magnesium as a therapeutic agent is being tested in numerous large clinical trials. This review focuses on clinical manifestations associated with magnesium deficiency and highlights the clinical significance of hypermagnesemia. Specific clinical conditions in which magnesium deficiency has been implicated to play a pathophysiological role, namely hypertension, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, prec-eclampsia, asthma and critical illness will be discussed and the possible therapeutic role of magnesium will be considered. Although there is still much to be learnt regarding the exact role of magnesium in clinical medicine, there are two conditions where magnesium is now considered the therapeutic agent of choice, pre-eclampsia and torsades de pointes. Future research, both at the fundamental and clinical levels, will certainly facilitate our understanding of how magnesium contributes to pathological processes and under what circumstances it should be used therapeutically.","inCitations":["37be949d5beee11e48f9679ce540e1f878156f01","f54cb09cbb8e0aee080895a97fceb26dedb399da","211496e95c651947d3cacc8e85c4ce70e2f1d6a7","ecffbef73f6b81652abe9800f33b76744a65bc1c","49658c1b4df86f17a39ad4836e7501963ae43402","1caa912b83b06dab55bdc63386908a9fad8c8634","15c4293f8d354cee99e7b3c5a48f33ff9080e258","1739491a83e42f9c46bec26964a4b622d0bb98f2","9d3b7069fe792dca00e85e64920073f5e49ab58f","2bffeba7d6aa64327096ea4f7fc16dbb6e8842d4","023b3afd127bdc7683a5df6f72ca5b7f50fda999","38ac6c528ea2216ee079ec71704a401e3059a6dd","fe4cc093d98c9f0e554751a7cb8bdfbb9730b482","f8809f8392e7250fa6ff4b514d2a1e051ef1873b","2b82b19c2208778af4198648276480c4820aa6b4","ea1445e7d77878c60ce4962c34498afcf925ea45","0f38753e093cd8cf19801eddf8569402ac8a6a61","3b806f3d0a66e358a3765b2498333c121e129fde","b4c36868b9f3ef1dd492477386efb8204f665dda","d01839086098774d820b54775d7cbc8877927734","c88096875bd7f81a47e901b4fbcc560ec07e97d9","12a8100a662291531cb3ace4fd82bbc160e737bf","f2a9cb48bea75a0f6e655b47613db7d3484a8ebc","392bb20f32a697fec7af81bfe0c3210eaf3c1687","c91ef7df37716018ab1764beaba17180fa514ca4","c41db968126de6d6ddc5511a79f1c72608ba080a","a52d9d1f3f682df4f2ad862a7e772a7cc40ae9e3","c9a6074b491ce483212d6d7ccaf1005bf32aadc1","93f5cb0e0c2d18f7996b7fc9f374aa2f148fce7f","46c17e7e6cb7b1b637c565ab4b84c89b5f7dd6f9","a175837fdd3be0f5888517ff41651bdd63ad4e73","8c3ba5fde44d44de8f00a538ffefa29208529faa","37a052c172e6eb0cf01f0bfc139f683980314dfe","29b91624d383ff3807ceca6dd82c7533f58148b3","3eaee3c84ae6f8e06ddf1d886f89dd73ef8eea73","f9dec46783ea3662b4902f506eb2764514a638b2","04ba370418fec7bde8170be66866888d564fd2c2","de831f6e1af689c82bf9c70850b6d6c8388685f7","f9d7aa5fbf70db0b56299c3cf6ed9f6216f7e1e1","a65bd82e45a3d440c4589e44020c892cdcde0e56","399e118006cf0d721b5690c33597036ffe5b2d03","8f328bb4d38c1338e14ae48ed40be19f1deef1e5","cf872f2b0f00cc90edd46d8cd3686819e07d8c24","b0ab06c9ccdcfd511f492eacb1b21c784a135968","55fc7204ccc29d03467bd8ed15c7eb025bfdd5f5","184ef0a4cd14f4d5b442144d7d2f2af10a70ceac","f91a76884db3f0014226f0400af74796074ed258","0062696e884b5459164b171d6aa5ac2f96e0e53a","e92c127889b74e12d03609ede236b985acb34418","10494dcad06c52cb5a7a6b28ebf39a59baf76132","f7c4a25d746e231df19f28d76807eb95a0c74ace","f00e64f8bba31bf8f3658ef955d6a619c44afd12","da75e401b4646d7a988754a2c9bfa65c49bdde74","4998b0b57a37e04ad0ccef9187de6d5da212d7ac","6d9043170d5bb3398ba056c4f710f84108ec262b","f69141376f78b9f86d5e662b23578ea8453b7d25","ece8d474e06722644edd829b4f5c33bb23012f0a","62b7d2319a66d18a3944ac95f9452e2440735b46","0f64ed0f9d4d90647a461f1f0846796b92ac07e0","3cff66819b22a48093745b279326202bf96918ff","09e85b42018c8aee4f3dbf167389fa3a11600771","708e4f85f1e3ecab4e50399748fb16329477e051","719682eacdda0376ad9998131257d719a0d62795","547e3ccae04af4b6b771bf861f8278596f5c8787"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Magnesium in clinical medicine.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library"}
